# UET Program Inquiry AI Assistant (AIT3001)

This project, developed for VNU University of Engineering and Technology (UET), implements an intelligent system to assist users with inquiries about university training programs. It features:

1.  A **Multi-Task Text Classification Model**: Trained to identify the relevant "Program Code" (Mã Ngành) and "Section Code" (Mã Mục) from a user's input question in Vietnamese. This model utilizes a fine-tuned PhoBERT architecture.
2.  An **AI-Powered Q&A Assistant**: Leverages the Google Gemini API to generate comprehensive answers to user questions, using context fetched from a knowledge base based on the classifier's predictions.

The application is deployed with a simple web interface using Gradio.

## Prerequisites

* Python 3.9+
* Pip (Python package installer)
* Git (for cloning the repository)
* Kaggle API configured (for downloading the trained model)

## Setup Instructions

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    Open your terminal or command prompt and run:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/its6ueq/AIT3001
    cd AIT3001
    ```

2.  **Install Required Libraries:**
    Install all necessary Python dependencies using the provided `requirements.txt` file:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    This will install libraries including `tensorflow`, `transformers`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `joblib`, `google-generativeai`, `gradio`, and `tf-keras`.

3.  **Configure Google Gemini API Key:**
    * You need a Google Gemini API key to use the AI Q&A feature. You can obtain one from [https://aistudio.google.com/apikey](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey).
    * Create a file named `config.py` in the root directory of the cloned project.
    * Add your Google Gemini API key to this file as follows:
        ```python
        # config.py
        API_KEY_GEMINI = "YOUR_ACTUAL_GEMINI_API_KEY"
        ```
        Replace `"YOUR_ACTUAL_GEMINI_API_KEY"` with your valid API key. This `config.py` file is (and should be) listed in `.gitignore` to prevent accidental sharing of your key.

4.  **Download Trained Model and Encoders from Kaggle:**
    The pre-trained classification model weights and encoder files are essential for the application to run. These are generated by the `train.ipynb` notebook, which is typically run on Kaggle.

    * Ensure you have the Kaggle API installed and configured. If not, install it (`pip install kaggle`) and follow the setup instructions on the [Kaggle API documentation](https://www.kaggle.com/docs/api).
    * From the root directory of your cloned project, run the following command in your terminal to download the model files from the specified Kaggle kernel (ensure the kernel `banghai/train` has been successfully run and committed with the model files in its output):
        ```bash
        kaggle kernels output banghai/train -p ./
        ```
    * This command will download the output of the kernel `banghai/train` into your current local directory. The output should include a `saved_model_output` directory.
    * After downloading, ensure the `saved_model_output` directory (containing `my_multitask_model_weights.weights.h5`, `encoder_nganh.joblib`, and `encoder_muc.joblib`) is present in the root of your local project directory. This directory is listed in `.gitignore`.

5.  **Ensure Data Files are Present:**
    The following CSV files should be present in the root of your project directory (they are included in the GitHub repository):
    * `cauhoimau.csv`: Sample questions used for training the classification model.
    * `chuong_trinh_dao_tao.csv`: The knowledge base with detailed program information, used by the AI assistant to fetch context.

## Running the Application

Once all setup steps are complete (libraries installed, API key configured, model/encoder files downloaded, and data files placed correctly), you can start the Gradio web interface by running the `main.py` script from the project's root directory:

```bash
python main.py
